# English-for-Kids-
An android app aimed to teach kids elementary english words
1. In the main screen, the user has to enter his/her name and age. The app remembers the username to address him/her in the following activities.
Also, I made the app available in russian too. So, in the bottom of the main screen, there is a button to change the language of the app. When the user clicks it, he/she sees a message on how to change the app language.

2. When the user successfully inputs all the required fields, we will move to screen 2. In screen 2, he/she will have to choose the category of the test. I have divided the words to different categories such as actions, family, emotions, etc.
When the user clicks one of the items in the list (eg: actions), he goes to the next screen where the game starts.
Also, there is a button to share the app with friends at the bottom of the page which will be done with the help of SMS with prepared text like "Hi, I found the app that to learn English. You should download it too!".

3. In screens 3-10, the user will have to guess the word shown in the picture. Every time he/she fails, there will be warning&wrong buzzler sound and a prompt asking the user to try again. The same with correct answer. 
Also, he/she can see the answer by clicking the button "see the answer".
